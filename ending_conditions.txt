1. A chicken makes an invalid move.  The game is terminated and that chicken loses.
2. A chicken runs out of time. The game is terminated and that chicken loses.
3. Both chickens have made 40 moves. The game is terminated and the chicken with the most eggs wins.
4. A chicken has no valid moves.  Its enemy is given 5 eggs, the game is terminated, and the chicken with the most eggs wins. (Note this is a bigger penalty than was listed in version 1.0 of the rules.)
5. If a chicken steps on a trapdoor and cannot occupy the square it spawned on, the enemy is given the 4 eggs (that it always gets when its enemy steps on a trapdoor), the game is terminated, and the chicken with the most eggs wins.
